# OOPs
OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that focuses on objects rather than functions. 
In OOP, you create objects that contain both data and methods that operate on that data. 
These objects can interact with each other to perform a variety of tasks.

The four main principles of OOP are:

1. Encapsulation: This means that data is kept within the object and is only accessible through its methods.

2. Inheritance: This allows objects to inherit properties and methods from their parent classes.

3. Polymorphism: This allows objects to take on multiple forms and behave differently based on their context.

4. Abstraction: This means that objects are represented at a high level, without showing their internal complexity.

OOP is widely used in software development as it allows for code to be easily maintained, reused and modified.
